# eliteSheets

##### An app tracking receivables and payables between at least two companies

This in-progress web application is designed to increase financial transparency between two or more companies. A user can sign up for the service, create a new spreadsheet, and add other eliteSheet users to his or her sheet. Everyone with access to that sheet can post their transactions on it, and these transactions are viewable by everyone who has been granted permission to to view the sheet by the sheet's creator. This is a React.js application with Passport.js used for authentication and MySQL and Sequelize used for the database.
